# GitHub Pages Portfolio (Corporate Style)

This is a simple, fast, and professional portfolio starter for engineers. It uses **plain HTML + CSS** and deploys on **GitHub Pages**.

## How to Use

1. Create a repository named `your-username.github.io` on GitHub (public).
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repo root (or push via Git).
3. Visit `https://your-username.github.io` (first build can take ~1 minute).

## Customize
- Replace placeholders like `your-github-username` and `your-linkedin-handle` in HTML.
- Drop your resume at `assets/resume/Isaac-Cooper-Resume.pdf` (update filename if needed).
- Add/duplicate project pages in `/projects` and update links on `index.html`.
- Colors and spacing are in `assets/css/styles.css` under the `:root` variables.

## Optional
- Add a custom domain in the repo: **Settings → Pages → Custom domain**.
- Add `CNAME` file with your domain (e.g., `isaaccooper.dev`).
